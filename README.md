# finalSpaceRNExample
General approach: 
- Simple folder structure
- React Native + NativeBase + Typescript + Axios + React Navigation 
- Simple theme just to showcase the potential use
- API calls directly in the screens (No State Management)
- "Card" component serves as an example of how components can be utilized as building reusable blocks
- Flatlist used to showcase the understanding of performance and potential need for pagination
- Showcase of async/await API consumption
- No extensive eslint, prettier and no inclusion of Husky
- App tested only on iOS 
- .env not included in gitignore just for the sake of simplicity :)
